# MiniRust prelude

Across all files in this repository, we assume some definitions to always be in scope.

```rust,ignore
/// All operations are fallible, so they return `Result`.  If they fail, that
/// means the program caused UB or put the machine to a halt.
pub type Result<T=()> = std::result::Result<T, TerminationInfo>;

#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum TerminationInfo {
  Ub(String),
  MachineStop(String),
}

/// Some macros for convenient yeeting (yes this is valid syntax on nightly Rust).
macro_rules! throw {
    ($($tt:tt)*) => { do yeet None };
}
macro_rules! throw_ub {
    ($($tt:tt)*) => { do yeet TerminationInfo::Ub(format!($($tt)*)) };
}
macro_rules! throw_machine_stop {
    ($($tt:tt)*) => { do yeet TerminationInfo::MachineStop(format!($($tt)*)) };
}
