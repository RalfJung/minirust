BigInt is the type of mathematical integers.

We assume all the usual arithmetic operations to be defined.
Additionally, BigInt provides a few utility functions.

```rust
pub use specr::BigInt;

impl BigInt {
    /// Converts any integer type to BigInt.
    pub fn from(x: impl Into<BigInt>) -> BigInt;

    /// Returns the next-higher power of two.
    pub fn next_power_of_two(&self) -> BigInt;

    /// Checks whether `self` is a power of two.
    pub fn is_power_of_two(&self) -> bool;

    /// Computes `self / other`, returns None if `other` is zero.
    pub fn checked_div(other: impl Into<BigInt>) -> Option<BigInt>;
}

/// Returns the unique value that is equal to `i` modulo `2^size.bits()`.
/// If `signed == Unsigned`, the result is in the interval `0..2^size.bits()`,
/// else it is in the interval `-2^(size.bits()-1) .. 2^(size.bits()-1)`.
///
/// `size` must not be zero.
pub fn modulo(i: BigInt, signed: Signedness, size: Size) -> BigInt {
    if size == 0 {
        panic!("BigInt::modulo received invalid size zero!");
    }

    // the modulus.
    let m = BigInt::from(2).pow(size.bits());

    // n is in range `-(m-1)..m`.
    let n = i % m;

    match signed {
        // if `Unsigned`, output needs to be in range `0..m`:
        Unsigned if n < 0 => n + m,
        // if `Signed`, output needs to be in range `-m/2 .. m/2`:
        Signed if n >= m/2 => n - m,
        Signed if n < -m/2 => n + m,
        _ => n,
    }
}

/// Tests whether an integer `i` is in-bounds of a finite integer type.
pub fn in_bounds(i: BigInt, signed: Signedness, size: Size) -> bool {
    i == modulo(i, signed, size)
}
```
