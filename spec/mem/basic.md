# MiniRust basic memory model

This is almost the simplest possible fully-feature implementation of the MiniRust memory model interface.
It does *not* model any kind of aliasing restriction, but otherwise should be enough to explain all the behavior and Undefined Behavior we see in Rust, in particular with respect to bounds-checks for memory accesses and pointer arithmetic.
This demonstrates well how the memory interface works, as well as the basics of "per-allocation provenance".
The full MiniRust memory model will likely be this basic model plus some [extra restrictions][Stacked Borrows] to ensure the program follows the aliasing rules; possibly with some extra tricks to [explain OOM-reducing optimizations](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/328).

## Data structures

The provenance tracked by this memory model is just an ID that identifies which allocation the pointer points to.
(We will pretend we can split the `impl ... for` block into multiple smaller blocks.)

```rust
pub struct AllocId(Int);

impl<T: Target> Memory for BasicMemory<T> {
    type Provenance = AllocId;
}
```

The data tracked by the memory is fairly simple: for each allocation, we track its data contents, its absolute integer address in memory, the alignment it was created with (the size is implicit in the length of the contents), and whether it is still alive (or has already been deallocated).

```rust
struct Allocation<Provenance, Extra = ()> {
    /// The data stored in this allocation.
    data: List<AbstractByte<Provenance>>,
    /// The address where this allocation starts.
    /// This is never 0, and `addr + data.len()` fits into a `usize`.
    addr: Address,
    /// The alignment that was requested for this allocation.
    /// `addr` will be a multiple of this.
    align: Align,
    /// The kind of this allocation.
    kind: AllocationKind,
    /// Whether this allocation is still live.
    live: bool,
    /// Additional information needed for the memory model
    extra: Extra,
}
```

Memory then consists of a map tracking the allocation for each ID, stored as a list (since we assign IDs consecutively).

```rust
pub struct BasicMemory<T: Target, AllocExtra = ()> {
    allocations: List<Allocation<AllocId, AllocExtra>>,

    // FIXME: specr should add this automatically
    _phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<T>,
}

impl<T: Target> Memory for BasicMemory<T> {
    type T = T;

    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { allocations: List::new(), _phantom: std::marker::PhantomData }
    }
}
```

## Operations

We start with some helper operations.

```rust
impl<Provenance, Extra> Allocation<Provenance, Extra> {
    fn size(self) -> Size { Size::from_bytes(self.data.len()).unwrap() }

    fn overlaps(self, other_addr: Address, other_size: Size) -> bool {
        let end_addr = self.addr + self.size().bytes();
        let other_end_addr = other_addr + other_size.bytes();
        if end_addr <= other_addr || other_end_addr <= self.addr {
            // Our end is before their beginning, or vice versa -- we do not overlap.
            // However, to make sure that each allocation has a unique address, we still
            // report overlap if both allocations have the same address.
            // FIXME: This is not necessarily realistic, e.g. for zero-sized stack variables.
            // OTOH the function pointer logic currently relies on this.
            self.addr == other_addr
        } else {
            true
        }
    }

    /// Check whether the deallocation is valid.
    fn deallocation_check(self, ptr_addr: Address, kind: AllocationKind, size: Size, align: Align) -> Result {
        if !self.live {
            throw_ub!("double-free");
        }
        if ptr_addr != self.addr {
            throw_ub!("deallocating with pointer not to the beginning of its allocation");
        }
        if kind != self.kind {
            throw_ub!("deallocating {:?} memory with {:?} deallocation operation", self.kind, kind);
        }
        if size != self.size() {
            throw_ub!("deallocating with incorrect size information");
        }
        if align != self.align {
            throw_ub!("deallocating with incorrect alignment information");
        }

        ret(())
    }

    /// Compute relative offset, and ensure we are in-bounds.
    /// We don't need a null ptr check, we just have an invariant that no allocation
    /// contains the null address.
    fn offset_in_alloc(&self, addr: Address, pointee_size: Size) -> Result<Size> {
        if !self.live {
            throw_ub!("dereferencing pointer to dead allocation");
        }

        let offset_in_alloc = addr - self.addr;
        if offset_in_alloc < 0 || offset_in_alloc + pointee_size.bytes() > self.size().bytes() {
            throw_ub!("dereferencing pointer outside the bounds of its allocation");
        }

        ret(Offset::from_bytes(offset_in_alloc).unwrap())
    }

    fn load(&self, addr: Address, offset: Size, len: Size, align: Align) -> Result<List<AbstractByte<Provenance>>> {
        if !align.is_aligned(addr) {
            throw_ub!("load from a misaligned pointer");
        }

        ret(self.data.subslice_with_length(offset.bytes(), len.bytes()))
    }

    fn store(&mut self, addr: Address, offset: Size, bytes: List<AbstractByte<Provenance>>, align: Align) -> Result {
        if !align.is_aligned(addr) {
            throw_ub!("store to a misaligned pointer");
        }

        // Slice into the contents, and put the new bytes there.
        self.data.write_subslice_at_index(offset.bytes(), bytes);

        ret(())
    }

    fn pick_base_address<T: Target>(allocations: List<Allocation<Provenance, Extra>>, size: Size, align: Align) -> NdResult<Int> {
        // Reject too large allocations. Size must fit in `isize`.
        if !T::valid_size(size) {
            throw_ub!("asking for a too large allocation");
        }
        // Pick a base address. We use daemonic non-deterministic choice,
        // meaning the program has to cope with every possible choice.
        // FIXME: This makes OOM (when there is no possible choice) into "no behavior",
        // which is not what we want.
        let distr = libspecr::IntDistribution {
            start: Int::ONE,
            end: Int::from(2).pow(T::PTR_SIZE.bits()),
            divisor: align.bytes(),
        };

        let addr = pick(
            distr,
            |addr: Address| {
                if addr <= 0 {
                    return false;
                }
                if !align.is_aligned(addr) {
                    return false;
                }
                if !(addr + size.bytes()).in_bounds(Unsigned, T::PTR_SIZE) {
                    return false;
                }
                if allocations.any(|a| a.live && a.overlaps(addr, size)) {
                    return false;
                }
                true
            },
        )?;

        ret(addr)
    }

    fn leak_check(allocations: List<Allocation<Provenance, Extra>>) -> Result {
        for allocation in allocations {
            if allocation.live {
                match allocation.kind {
                    // These should all be gone.
                    AllocationKind::Heap => throw_memory_leak!(),
                    // These we can still have at the end.
                    AllocationKind::Global | AllocationKind::Function | AllocationKind::Stack => {}
                }
            }
        }
        ret(())
    }
}
```

Then we implement creating and removing allocations.

```rust
impl<T: Target> Memory for BasicMemory<T> {
    fn allocate(&mut self, kind: AllocationKind, size: Size, align: Align) -> NdResult<Pointer<AllocId>> {
        let addr = Allocation::pick_base_address::<T>(self.allocations, size, align)?;

        // Compute allocation.
        let allocation = Allocation {
            addr,
            align,
            kind,
            live: true,
            data: list![AbstractByte::Uninit; size.bytes()],
            extra: (),
        };

        // Insert it into list, and remember where.
        let id = AllocId(self.allocations.len());
        self.allocations.push(allocation);

        // And we are done!
        ret(Pointer { addr, provenance: Some(id) })
    }

    fn deallocate(&mut self, ptr: Pointer<AllocId>, kind: AllocationKind, size: Size, align: Align) -> Result {
        let Some(id) = ptr.provenance else {
            throw_ub!("deallocating invalid pointer")
        };
        // This lookup will definitely work, since AllocId cannot be faked.
        let allocation = self.allocations[id.0];

        allocation.deallocation_check(ptr.addr, kind, size, align)?;

        // Mark it as dead. That's it.
        self.allocations.mutate_at(id.0, |allocation| {
            allocation.live = false;
        });

        ret(())
    }
}
```

The key operations of a memory model are of course handling loads and stores.
The helper function `check_ptr` we define for them is also used to implement the final part of the memory API, `dereferenceable`.

```rust
impl<T: Target> BasicMemory<T> {
    /// Check if the given pointer is dereferenceable for an access of the given
    /// length. For dereferenceable, return the allocation ID and
    /// offset; this can be missing for invalid pointers and accesses of size 0.
    fn check_ptr(&self, ptr: Pointer<AllocId>, len: Size) -> Result<Option<(AllocId, Size)>> {
        // For zero-sized accesses, there is nothing to check.
        // (Provenance monotonicity says that if we allow zero-sized accesses
        // for `None` provenance we have to allow it for all provenance.)
        if len.is_zero() {
            return ret(None);
        }
        // We do not even have to check for null, since no allocation will ever contain that address.
        // Now try to access the allocation information.
        let Some(id) = ptr.provenance else {
            // An invalid pointer.
            throw_ub!("dereferencing pointer without provenance");
        };
        let allocation = self.allocations[id.0];

        // Compute relative offset
        let offset = allocation.offset_in_alloc(ptr.addr, len)?;

        // All is good!
        ret(Some((id, offset)))
    }
}

impl<T: Target> Memory for BasicMemory<T> {
    fn load(&mut self, ptr: Pointer<AllocId>, len: Size, align: Align) -> Result<List<AbstractByte<AllocId>>> {
        let Some((id, offset)) = self.check_ptr(ptr, len)? else {
            return ret(list![]);
        };
        let allocation = &self.allocations[id.0];
        allocation.load(ptr.addr, offset, len, align)
    }

    fn store(&mut self, ptr: Pointer<Self::Provenance>, bytes: List<AbstractByte<Self::Provenance>>, align: Align) -> Result {
        let size = Size::from_bytes(bytes.len()).unwrap();
        let Some((id, offset)) = self.check_ptr(ptr, size)? else {
            return ret(());
        };

        let mut allocation = self.allocations[id.0];
        allocation.store(ptr.addr, offset, bytes, align)?;
        self.allocations.set(id.0, allocation);

        ret(())
    }

    fn dereferenceable(&self, ptr: Pointer<Self::Provenance>, len: Size) -> Result {
        self.check_ptr(ptr, len)?;
        ret(())
    }
}
```

The memory leak check checks if there are any heap allocations left.
Stack allocations are fine; they get automatically cleaned up when a function returns and when the start function calls `exit`, its locals are still around.

```rust
impl<T: Target> Memory for BasicMemory<T> {
    fn leak_check(&self) -> Result {
        Allocation::leak_check(self.allocations)
    }
}
```
